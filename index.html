    <h2>What is it?</h2>
    <p>The Self-Stabilizing Spoon is a smart assistive device designed to help people suffering from Parkinson’s disease eat more comfortably. It uses motion sensors and motors to detect hand tremors and stabilize the spoon in real-time.</p>

    <h2>Why is it Needed?</h2>
    <p>Parkinson’s disease often causes hand tremors that make it difficult to eat independently. This can lead to frustration, loss of dignity, and dependence on others. A self-stabilizing spoon improves quality of life and restores confidence during meals.</p>

    <div class="feature">
      <h3>Key Features</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Built-in gyroscope and accelerometer</li>
        <li>Real-time tremor compensation using motors</li>
        <li>Rechargeable battery with long life</li>
        <li>Easy to clean and food-safe design</li>
        <li>Interchangeable spoon and fork heads</li>
      </ul>
    </div>

    <h2>How Does It Work?</h2>
    <p>The spoon uses sensors to detect unintended hand movements. A microcontroller processes the signals and activates small motors to counteract the tremors, keeping the spoon head steady while the user eats.</p>

    <h2>Benefits</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Increases user independence</li>
      <li>Improves mental well-being</li>
      <li>Reduces mess and frustration</li>
      <li>Supports caregivers by easing mealtime difficulties</li>
    </ul>
